## Project Description
UNMC has comprised a working group of health professionals, environmental scientists, and engineers to work on how pollution can negatively impact health. UNMC has partnered with AirPurple to help monitor pollution across Nebraska. Air quality is not a specialty of anyone currently affiliated with UNMC, so they have opened a request for proposals from engineering firms to help UNMC analyze the air quality data set. Our engineering firm won the proposal and is now tasked with completing the data analysis.
The goal of this project is to provide an analysis of air quality data from across Nebraska for a request for proposals from the UNMC Water, Climate, and Health working group. The client has asked for the following analyses: (1) an overall statistical analysis to determine the five locations with the highest mean and median concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5, and PM 10.0, (2) an analysis of when and where maximum values of VOC, PM 2.5, and PM 10.0 occurred, and research of potential causes, (3) an analysis into the effects temperature and humidity has on air quality, and (4) find instances of Air Quality Index (AQI) health risks at any location for PM 2.5 and PM 10.0 based on the EPA’s AQI ratings.
